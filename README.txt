of nonconservative nonlinear Schroedinger equations".

SUMMARY

This code computes the space-time Fourier coefficients of monochromatic 
initial data to the 1d quadratic NLS:   
    i u_t = d_xx u + u^2
where x is taken in the 1-torus R / 2 \pi Z. 

In particular, this means that the variable omega in the paper is taken to 
equal 1, and as such does not appear as a variable in the code. 
The initial data considered in this software is 
    u_0(x) := A e^{i x}
for a complex scalar A. 

With the Fourier coefficients computed, this code is set up to 
(1) Produce a computer-assisted-proof of the existence of a periodic orbit
(2) Generate figure displaying the periodic orbits
(3) Estimate the critical value of A* between where the Fourier 
    coefficients grow/decay exponentially. 

These code for part (1) requires the INTLAB interval arithmetic library:

Data Files 

Coeff_110_intval.mat    -- The Fourier coefficients c_{n,j} computed  
                            USING interval arithmetic, 
                            for A=3 & 1<=n<=110

Coeff_300.mat           -- The Fourier coefficients c_{n,j} computed  
                            NOT USING interval arithmetic, 
                            for A=1 & 1<=n<=300

(Note: By the rescaling in Theorem 3.1, the coefficients for one value of A 
can be easily used to calculate the coefficients for another value of A. 
This is utilized in the Script_ProduceFigures. However the computation for 
the rescaling will introduce some rounding error.)
